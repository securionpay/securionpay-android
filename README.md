# SecurionPay Android SDK

Welcome to SecurionPay Android SDK. Framework makes it easy to add SecurionPay payments to your mobile apps. It allows you to integrate SecurionPay with just a few lines of code. It also provides customizable UI elements and exposes low-level SecurionPay API from which you can create a custom payment form.

## Features

#### Security

All sensitive data is sent directly to our servers instead of using your backend, so you can be sure that your payments are highly secure.

#### 3D-Secure

Add a smart 3D Secure verification with superior UX to your transactions. Provide smooth and uninterrupted payment experience that doesnâ€™t interfere with your conversion process.

#### SecurionPay API

We provide methods corresponding to SecurionPay API. It allows you creating an entirely custom UI embedded into your application to increase conversion by keeping clients inside your app.

#### Translations

You can process payments in 18 languages.

## Requirements and limitations

Strict requirements of PCI 3DS SDK make development impossible. Running on simulator or debugging are forbidden in a production build of your application. We provide two versions of Framework both for Debug and Release builds so you can create and debug your application without any issues.

Releasing using a store other than Play Store is forbidden by default. If you want to use a different store, for example Firebase App Distribution, you have to provide their identifiers as described below.

## Play Store Review

To ensure that an application using our SDK successfully passes the review process to the Play Store, we have integrated it into the SecurionPay application. It also allows you to familiarize yourself with the features of our Framework in a convenient way. To do this, download the application (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.securionpay.securionpay), then in the Profile tab, turn on the test mode. A Developers section will appear at the bottom of the screen with a demonstration of the Framework.

## Installation

Add `securionpay-android` to your `build.gradle` dependencies.

```
dependencies {
    releaseImplementation 'com.securionpay:securionpay-android:1.0.2'
    debugImplementation 'com.securionpay:securionpay-android-debug:1.0.2'
}
```

## Usage

If you have not created an account yet, you can do it here: https://securionpay.com/signup.

### Configuration

To configure the framework you need to provide the public key. You can find it here: https://securionpay.com/account-settings. Notice that there are two types of keys: live and test. The type of key determines application mode. Make sure you used a live key in build released to Play Store.

Framework also requires you to specify App Signature. This property should be set to the SHA256 fingerprint of the certificate used to sign the app. You can find it in Google Play Console. Any attempt to perform the 3D Secure operation in release mode results in error if they do not match. This value should not be hardcoded in the application for security reasons. You should provide it on your backend side. 

Releasing using a store other than Play Store is forbidden by default. If you want to use a different store, for example Firebase App Distribution, you have to provide their identifiers. 

```kotlin
val publicKey = "pk_test_..."
val signature = "00:11:22...."
val trustedAppStores = listOf("com.google.android.packageinstaller") // Firebase App Distribution
val securionPay = SecurionPay(applicationContext, publicKey, signature, trustedAppStores)
```

### Checkout Dialog

Checkout Dialog is an out-of-box solution designed to provide the smoothest payment experience possible. It is a simple overlay with payments that appears on top of your page. Well-designed and ready to use. 

To present Checkout Dialog you need to create Checkout Request on your backend side. You can find more informations about Checkout Requests here: https://securionpay.com/docs/api#checkout-request. You can also create test Checkout Request here: https://securionpay.com/docs/checkout-request-generator.

```kotlin
val checkoutRequest = CheckoutRequest("...")
securionPay.showCheckoutDialog(this, checkoutRequest)
```

To receive the callback from Checkout Dialog, you must implement interface `SecurionPay.CheckoutDialogFragmentResultListener`.

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity(), SecurionPay.CheckoutDialogFragmentResultListener {
    override fun onCheckoutFinish(result: Result<ChargeResult>?) {
        result?.let {
            when (it.status) {
                Status.SUCCESS -> {
                    Log.i("SP", it.data!!.id!!)
                }
                Status.ERROR -> {
                    Log.e("SP", it.error?.message(this)!!)
                }
            }
        } ?: run {
            Log.i("SP","Cancelled")
        }
    }    
}
```

#### Saved cards

Checkout View Controller has a feature allowing to remember cards used before. To delete them, use code:

```kotlin
securionPay.cleanSavedCards()
```

## Testing

When making requests in test mode you have to use special card numbers to simulate successful charges or processing errors. You can find list of card numbers here: https://securionpay.com/docs/testing. You can check status of every charge you made here: https://securionpay.com/charges.

Remember not to make too many requests in a short period of time or you may reach a rate limit. If you reach the limit you have to wait 24h.
